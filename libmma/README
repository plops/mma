This directory contains different programs to control the micro mirror array.


*mma-cmd:

This program is directly linked to libIPMS_SLM.so and the most
important functions can be called from a text based interface. One can
use this to control the MMA over network or from scripting languages.

It is the only program that allows stable operation.


The following programs are not necessarily stable.  The reasons are
not know.



*libmma.h, libmma.so:

This library provides mma_init and mma_uninit for easy connection to
the MMA system in Kings College London. Change libmma.c if one uses a
different board.




*reset:

Issues reset command to the board. This seems to have the same effect
as power cycling the control board. You will have to wait for at least
10s for the board to boot up again. You will also have to wait until
TIME_WAIT disappears from 'netstat -ant|grep 192.168.0' before 


*mma:

Displays a bright disc on the MMA for 3 seconds.



*libmma.lisp:

Example how to call libmma from SBCL.  Beware: There are bugs and
ideally this approach shouldn't be used as the direct libIPMS_SLM.so
binding in mma/ffi.lisp and mma/ipms.lisp is much more flexible.


*burn:

Code to scan a rectangular window over the MMA. Unfortunately this
code crashes.



*dl/mma.c:

Dynamic linking approach to open libIPMS_SLM. This was doesn't help
with the bugs.
